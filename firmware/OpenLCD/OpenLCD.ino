  OpenLCD is an LCD with serial/i2c/spi interfaces.

  OpenLCD gives the user multiple interfaces (serial, I2C, and SPI) to control an LCD. SerLCD was the original
  serial LCD from SparkFun that ran on the PIC 16F88 with only a serial interface and limited feature set.
  This is an updated serial LCD.

  Select 'SerLCD v2' as the board. We use an ATmega328P running at 11.0592MHz in order to have error free serial comm.

  Backlight levels from original datasheet are wrong. Setting of 22 is 76%. See google doc

  Todo:
  -Add software PWM to control blue backlight
  Add ability to add custom characters
  -Check for size jumper
  Check how splash screen works on 16 vs 20 width displays
  -Display message when resetting baud rate
  -Display message when changing baud rate
  -Add additional baud rates
  -Document support for 1 line LCDs
  -Add support for custom I2C addresses. This might be a third tier command in order to maintain backwards compatibility
  -Can we shut down/sleep while we wait for incoming things? (not really)
  -Add watchdog so that we never freeze/fail
  -Create and document support for re_init command: 124 then 8. Does SerLCD v2 have a clear or reset everything command? It should. Document it.
  -Emergency reset to 9600bps
  -Add PWM software support for blue backlight control on pin 8
  Test blue backlight control
  Test WDT fail
  -Test low level scrolling and cursor commands
  -Test cursor move left/right, on edges
  -Test emergency reset
  -Current measurements
  -Create docs for LCD manufacturer
  -Create SPI examples
  Establish and cut down on boot time

  Tests:
  -Change LCD width to 20, then back to 16 (124/3, then 124/4) then send 18 characters and check for wrap
  -Enable/Disable splash screen, send 124 then 9 to toggle, then power cycle
  -Change baud rate: 124/12 to go to 4800bps, power cycle, send characters at 4800
